# Those Who Came Before

## What is TWCB About?

A narrative game about understanding vanished cultures by interpreting procedurally generated artefacts.

### What is TWCB *Really* About?

It's about how we talk about other people, and the self-imposed limits we create through our assumptions.

### Inspiration

- All the knowledge lost when Mayan books were burned
- The Bronze Age Collapse
- The Basque language's lost relatives
